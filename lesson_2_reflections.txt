What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the initialization step creates the files that git needs to track the contents of a project. However it does not actually run an initial commit! you need to do that yourself

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a holding pen for a future commit. It allows you to assemble past files with new files that need to be tracked and then commit the logical change as a cohesive unit. Separating this from the working directory allows you to maintain untracked data alongside your repo.
