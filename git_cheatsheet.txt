More importantly: how to make a commit:
git init
git init
git add <file>
git add <file>
git commit 
*type in the name of the change (like "add helloworld.pl to repository")
:x

Back to most recent commit: git checkout master
Get a new git: git clone <whatever URL>

look at all commits: git log
look at "status": git status
back to master: git checkout master

Diff:
default to wd vs staging: git diff 
staging vs last change: git diff --staged
commit1 v commit2: git diff ID1 ID2
diff ignores whitespace: git diff -w

remove all changes (!!! careful son!): git reset --hard

show current branches: git branch
create a new branch name on this checked out guy: git branch *name*
name the new branch you are on: git checkout -b *branchname*

compare a commit to its parent: git show
merging: git merge (end label [master?]) (merged label)

list remotes: git remote 
list remotes with urls: git remote -v
set up a remote: git remote *origin/name* *url*
change remote: git remote set-url
push and pull: git *push/pull* *origin/name* *master/branch*
pull remote changes, but don't merge yet: git fetch

Note that pull is like fetch+merge!
