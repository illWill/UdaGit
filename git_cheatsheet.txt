More importantly: how to make a commit:
git init
git init
git add <file>
git add <file>
git commit 
*type in the name of the change (like "add helloworld.pl to repository")
:x

Back to most recent commit: git checkout master
Get a new git: git clone <whatever URL>

look at all commits: git log
look at "status": git status
back to master: git checkout master

Diff:
default to wd vs staging: git diff 
staging vs last change: git diff --staged
commit1 v commit2: git diff ID1 ID2
diff ignores whitespace: git diff -w

remove all changes (!!! careful son!): git reset --hard
