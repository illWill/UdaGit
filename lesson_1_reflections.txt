How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff used its internal algorithm to find lines at which the file differed
it also allowed us to ignore the lines on which the files were the same
this brought attention to the key points

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It might make it possible to revert far into the past
or to catch errors at intermediate points where you might not have otherwise kept a unique file


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

for most purposes files are not interdependent, and so saving them all together does not make sense
saving separately prevents duplication of identical files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log allows you to review the entire history of the project, viewing all commits
git diff allows you to compare two specific commits and see the exact changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

By being able to revert back to prior versions, it might be easier to go forward knowing that new errors introduced could be resolved.
